## **Overview**

Haid is a humanitarian aid distribution system powered by the Hedera Guardian network.
It brings transparency, dignity, and efficiency to how food, medical supplies, and essentials reach displaced people and refugees.

The platform connects NGOs, volunteers, donors, and recipients in one trusted ecosystem, using Hedera’s DIDs and immutable event logs to guarantee fairness and accountability.

---

## **Problem Statement**

Millions of displaced people struggle to access aid because of broken systems: no formal identity, fraudulent claims, and chaotic manual processes.
For NGOs and donors, it’s almost impossible to see where aid actually goes or verify how it’s used.

This lack of transparency creates waste, slows down distribution, and erodes trust. Haid fixes this by putting identity, distribution, and accountability all on Hedera’s distributed ledger.

---

## **Solution**

Each refugee receives a waterproof **Haid Band** embedded with an **NFC chip** that contains a unique **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** on Hedera Guardian.
For the hackathon, this is represented by a **QR code**, used purely for demo purposes due to financial constraints.

When a volunteer scans a band, the system instantly verifies the recipient’s identity and logs the distribution on Hedera.
NGOs can then track events in real time, while donors and auditors can see exactly how aid moves; all recorded immutably on-chain.

## **Why Hedera Guardian**

Haid uses **Hedera Guardian**, the open-source sustainability platform that enables verifiable, tamper-proof data management.

We leverage:

* **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)** for timestamped, immutable event records.
* **Hedera Decentralized Identity (DID)** for privacy-preserving user identity.
* **Guardian Indexer** for transparent data visualization and verification.

Together, these components make Haid scalable, auditable, and affordable; ideal for high-impact humanitarian operations.
